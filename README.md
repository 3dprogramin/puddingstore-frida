# PuddingStore - Frida reverse engineering

Welcome to the PuddingStore repository! This project demonstrates reverse engineering and dynamic modification of an Android application using Frida and a few other tools.

### Overview

This repository contains an Android application both compiled and source code, as well as the Frida script that is used to inject the app. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how to intercept and manipulate the logic of an Android app, specifically the login functionality.
